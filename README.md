Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial consulting firm that sought to modernize their software with a focus on security. This focus was mainly invested into adding a checksum verification feature that enables secure data transfer.



What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I found that research was my strong point during this project. I did tons of research into the various capabilities of the application and which security measures would be best to implement after carefully reviewing the starter files as well as the company's software requirements. Coding securely is crucial for protecting sensitive data while also mainting a high level of trust between the company and any clients. Secure coding also helps when attempting to adhere to regulatory standards while preventing data breaches. 



What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Identification of which areas needed reinforcement was hard but also extremely insightful. It made me research in a way that involved constantly evolving to adapt to a new problem at a moment's notice.



How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased security by adding encryption layers, hashing, error handling, and a CORS configuration. Future security assessments would include continuous monitoring alongside vulnerability scanning tools. Tools like the OWSAP dependency-check are also extremely helpful when trying to reduce potential vulnerabilities within an application's security layers. 


How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Thorough testing and manual code reviews were techniques that i used to ensure functionality and security within the application. Post-refactoring involved looking for any new vulnerabilities that may have appeared during the process. 



What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

This project taught me secure coding practices alongside the utilization of the Java Keytool to generate a certificate and springboot feature research to implement layers of security. 



Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

This assignment demonstrates my abilities to implement new security measures by utilizing strategies to accurately address vulnerabilities. This was accomplished and well documented in order to explain the thinking behind my decisions.
